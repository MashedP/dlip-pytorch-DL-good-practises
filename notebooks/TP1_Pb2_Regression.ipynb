To do this, for each possible input $x$, the network will output the parameters of the distribution modeling $p(y|x)$. For instance in our case, we choose to model output distributions with Gaussian distributions $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)$, which are parameterized by their mean $\\mu$ and their standard deviation $\\sigma$. Therefore for each input $x$ we have to output two quantities: $\\mu(x)$ and $\\sigma(x)$. The probability becomes: $$p(y_i | x_i) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\sigma(x_i)^2}}e^{-\\frac{(y_i - \\mu(x_i))^2}{2\\sigma(x_i)^2}}$$ Then the loss function becomes: $$L =\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}  \\frac{1}{2} \\log ( 2\\pi\\sigma_i^{2} ) + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma_i^{2}}  (y_{i} - \\mu_i)^{2}$$ If we set $\\sigma=1$, we obtain MSE the loss function. \n",
